.SYNOPSIS
    Deletes student-related repositories in a GitHub organization based on a name pattern.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script lists all repositories in a specified organization, filters out template repositories,
    and then identifies student repositories using a regular expression pattern on the repository name.
    It will prompt for confirmation before deleting each repository unless the -Force switch is used.

.PARAMETER OrgName
    The GitHub organization to scan for repositories. Defaults to 'jccc-oop'.

.PARAMETER Pattern
    A regular expression used to identify student repositories by name.
    The default pattern matches names that start with an alphanumeric user prefix followed by a hyphen,
    which is consistent with the 'Create-StudentRepo.ps1' script.

.PARAMETER Force
    If specified, the script will delete matching repositories without prompting for confirmation.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Clean-StudentRepos.ps1
    Scans the 'jccc-oop' organization and interactively prompts to delete repositories like 'dgerman3-assignment-1'.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Clean-StudentRepos.ps1 -Force
    Deletes all matching student repositories in 'jccc-oop' without confirmation.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Clean-StudentRepos.ps1 -Pattern '^testuser-'
    Deletes repositories starting with 'testuser-'.
